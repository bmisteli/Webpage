I﻿ am a young limnologist currently working as a PostDoc at WasserCluster Lunz. In my young career, I gathered experience in a broad range of aquatic systems (springs, intermittent streams, ponds, shallow lakes and rivers) working on various topics from biodiversity (macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, phytoplankton) to ecosystem management. Currently working on the RESTORE4Cs project, studying the potential of coastal wetland restoration as a tool for climate change mitigation in Europe.
